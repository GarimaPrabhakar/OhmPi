**Introduction to OhmPi** 
************************* 

This article presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware /
resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. 
Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer /
that allows performing automatic measurements with up to 32 electrodes

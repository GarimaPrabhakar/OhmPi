OS installation on a Raspberry Pi 
****************************************** 

The first step is to start up the Raspberry Pi board, including installation of an OS (operating system). 
For this step, the installation instructions are well described on the Raspberry website 
https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/2/). The authors recommend installing the latest 
stable and complete version of Raspbian by using NOOBS (a simple-to-use operating system installer). 
Once the OS has been installed, the 1-wire option and GPIO remote option must be deactivated via the
Raspbian GUI settings menu. Failure to carry out this task may cause damage to the relay shield cards during measurements.

**Introduction to OhmPi** 
************************* 

This article presents the development of a low-cost, open hardware \ 
resistivity meter to provide the scientific community with a robust \
and flexible tool for small-scale experiments. Called OhmPi, this basic resistivity meter\
features current injection and measurement functions associated with a multiplexer \
that allows performing automatic measurements with up to 32 electrodes.\ 
OhmPi's philosophy is to provide a fully open source and open hardware tool /
to the near surface scientific community.
